The TTI (Travel Time Index) industry's most used evaluation index of urban 
congestion degree is the ratio of the actual travel time and the free flow time.
The larger the value, the worse the traffic operation status, and the congestion 
level is generally positive. Related, other abnormal weather conditions (such as rain, snow, fog, etc.)
or abnormal road conditions may also affect the value of TTI.

Free flow refers to the speed of travel that a motor vehicle can achieve at low traffic and low density. In the actual calculation, the average of the fastest cumulative 4-hour sample speed in one month is used as the free flow of the road segment.

The cumulative number of vehicles passing through the road segment was observed as the weight value within one month.

Custom TTI analysis allows users to use the DD's massive traffic information database of Drips to calculate TTI, velocity, standard deviation and other data to analyze the travel characteristics of an area. It is possible to calculate TTI data for any time period and any range since November 2016.

Analyze the speed of the road segment to determine the bottleneck causing congestion and its impact
Analyze traffic times before and after road network changes to assess impact or improvement
Detect seasonality, the impact of events and events on traffic congestion or density
Measure the accessibility of a route or area annually
Identify and prioritize bottlenecks that cause congestion in an area
